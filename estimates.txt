Based on selected config(20 gb db, backup every 24 hours, response time 15 minutes) RTO/RPO numbers are the following

1) Min RTO for single AZ outage - 45 minutes (response time of support 15 minutes + backup retention period 30 minutes )

2) Min RTO for single region outage - 1 hour (response time of support 15 minutes + backup retention and promotion of replica is 45 minutes )

3) Min RPO for single AZ outage - several minutes(failover to readreplica)

4) Min RPO or single region outage - 24 hours (as we backup every 24 hours)


Estimates are based on inavailablity of service time of 1 hour and hours of work lose time of 1 hour.
Also bandwidth in single AZ is higher than in multiple ones. This affects the recovery time
as well as assumed bandwidth difference can be up to two times.
